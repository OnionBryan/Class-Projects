# Interactive Leadership Meta-Analysis Presentation

This project is an interactive web-based presentation of the findings from the 2004 meta-analysis by Timothy A. Judge and Ronald F. Piccolo, titled "Transformational and Transactional Leadership: A Meta-Analytic Test of Their Relative Validity."

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide an engaging and accessible way to explore the results of this influential study. The presentation is divided into two parts:

1.  **`index.html`**: A visually-driven, interactive summary of the key findings, designed for a general audience. It includes interactive charts and a leadership effectiveness calculator.
2.  **`index2.html`**: A more detailed, academic-focused presentation of the meta-analysis, with comprehensive data tables and in-depth explanations of the methodology and implications.

## How to View

This is a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To view the presentation, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

The website is also deployed on GitHub Pages and can be viewed at [https://onionbryan.github.io/Class-Project/](https://onionbryan.github.io/Class-Project/).
